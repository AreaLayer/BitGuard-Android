            3.1.2 You may use the App solely in accordance with these Terms.  You shall not take any steps to circumvent, avoid, bypass or obviate, directly or indirectly, the intent of these Terms.
            3.1.3 Your use of the App allows you to (i) store Supported Assets; (ii) view information that are part of a Supported Asset Network; (iii) process Wallet Asset Transfers; (iv) a dispenser for Test Net BTC; and (v) additional functionality as Bitfinex Labs may add to the App from time to time.
            3.1.4 You own and control Supported Assets held in your App.  As the owner of Supported Assets in your App, you bear all risk of loss of such Supported Assets.  Bitfinex Labs shall have no liability for Digital Asset fluctuations or loss associated with your use of the App.  At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Supported Assets by sending them to another Wallet Address utilizing the applicable Supported Assets Network.
        3.2 Limitations of App
            3.2.1 We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your license to the App without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of these Terms, or for no reason.  Upon any termination, (i) all rights and/or licenses granted to you under these Terms shall immediately cease and terminate and you shall forthwith cease the use of the App in any way whatsoever; and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, you will continue to be bound by these Terms.
            3.2.2 The App is intended solely for proper use of Supported Assets.  Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your App to store, send, com.iriswallet.data.db.getRequest, or receive any assets other than Supported Assets.
            3.2.3 To use the App you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the App.  Bitfinex Labs does not warrant that the App will be compatible with your mobile device.  You may use mobile data in connection with the App and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services.  You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges.
        3.3 Google Play Store App. The following applies to the App you acquire from the Google Play Store (“Google-Sourced Software”): (i) you acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Bitfinex Labs only, and not with Google, Inc. (“Google”); (ii) your use of Google-Sourced Software must comply with Google’s then-current Google Play Store Terms of Service; (iii) Google is only a provider of the Google Play Store where you obtained the Google-Sourced Software; (iv) Bitfinex Labs, and not Google, is solely responsible for its Google-Sourced Software; (v) Google has no obligation or liability to you with respect to Google-Sourced Software or these Terms; and (vi) you acknowledge and agree that Google is a third-party beneficiary to these Terms as it relates to Bitfinex Labs’ Google-Sourced Software.
        3.4 Digital Asset Transfers
            3.4.1 Your App enables you to send Supported Assets to, and receive Supported Assets from, other Waller Addresses, including Wallet Addresses controlled by third parties.  Your transfer of Supported Assets between other Wallet Addresses you control and to and from Wallet Addresses controlled by third parties is a “Wallet Asset Transfer”.
            3.4.2 Use of the RGB Test Net Protocol requires that the User maintain a UTXO in the Wallet Address associated with the App.  It is therefore necessary to transfer Test Net BTC into the App before conducting any Wallet Asset Transactions.  We recommend Users only Wallet Asset Transfer a small amount of Test Net BTC into the App at any time.
            3.4.3 Once a Wallet Asset Transfer is submitted to a Supported Asset Network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to allow confirmation of the transaction by the Supported Asset Network.  A Wallet Asset Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state.  Pending Wallet Asset Transfers that are initiated from the App will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use in the App or otherwise while the transaction is pending.
            3.4.4 When you or a third party sends Digital Assets to the App from another Wallet Address (“Wallet Inbound Transfers”), the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which includes ensuring that the Digital Asset being sent is a Supported Asset.
            3.4.5 When you send Supported Assets from your App to an external Wallet (“Wallet Outbound Transfers”), such transfers are executed at your instruction. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a Receiver of a Wallet Asset Transfer. Wallet Asset Transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Supported Asset Network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. You acknowledge and agree that you may be required to pay network or miner’s fees in order for a Wallet Outbound Transfer transaction to be successful.  Insufficient network fees may cause a Wallet Outbound Transfer to remain in a pending state outside of Bitfinex Labs’ control, and Bitfinex Labs shall not be responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.
            3.4.6 We do not charge fees for the App we make available to you.  There is no assurance that gas or other fees will not be charged by the RGB Test Net Protocol or any other Supported Asset Network.
            3.4.7 Bitfinex Labs does not control the Supported Asset Networks and makes no guarantees that a Wallet Asset Transfer will be confirmed by a Supported Asset Network. Bitfinex Labs is not responsible for the availability or legitimacy of, the content, products, assets, or services on or accessible from Supported Asset Networks.  Supported Asset Networks may provide access to Digital Assets which have high risks of illiquidity, devaluation, lockup, or loss.

The following claims and causes of action will be excluded from arbitration as described in Section 13.2: causes of action or claims in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged un-Lawful use of the App or its confidential information or private data. The Parties shall be at liberty to pursue claims or causes of actions excluded from arbitration through any court of competent jurisdiction.
        13.3 Delegation. The arbitrator will have the power to hear and determine challenges to their jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement. This authority extends to jurisdictional challenges with respect to both the subject matter of the dispute and the parties to the arbitration. Further, the arbitrator will have the power to determine the existence, validity, or scope of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, each clause within this Section 13 will be considered as separable from any contract of which it forms a part.  Any challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, except challenges based on the award itself, will be made not later than the notice of defense or, with respect to a counterclaim, the reply to the counterclaim; provided, however, that if a claim or counterclaim is later added or amended such a challenge may be made not later than the com.iriswallet.data.db.getResponse to such claim or counterclaim as provided under ICC Rules.

        13.5 Confidentiality. You and Bitfinex Labs and any other arbitration parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
        13.6 JURY TRIAL WAIVER. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR ANY BREACH THEREOF, ANY USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE APP BY YOU, AND/OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE USER AND BITFINEX LABS.
